# Diabetes-Prediction-project-using-SQL-

hrilled to share our latest breakthrough in healthcare data analytics ‚Äì an innovative Diabetes Prediction using SQL project! üåêüíâ Here's a quick overview:

The Challenge:
Addressing the global concern of diabetes by predicting and managing it early for improved healthcare outcomes.
The Solution: SQL Magic!
We harnessed the power of SQL's robust querying and statistical functions to analyze and transform healthcare data into actionable insights.

Key Steps:
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepped the dataset for optimal analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features to enhance accuracy.
    Statistical Analysis: Leveraged SQL functions for correlations and gained deeper insights.
    Model Development: Constructed predictive models using SQL queries and ML techniques.
    Validation and Optimization: Rigorously tested and fine-tuned to ensure reliability.
    
#Insights#

1.Patient Demographics: The project provided valuable insights into the demographics of patients, including their ages and genders.
2.Health Conditions Analysis: By ranking patients based on blood glucose levels and identifying those with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, the project offers insights into the prevalence and coexistence of various health conditions.

3.HbA1c Levels: Identifying patients with the highest and lowest HbA1c levels provides insights into glycemic control within the population.
4.BMI Trends: Calculating the average BMI and retrieving patients with a BMI greater than the average allows for the analysis of body mass trends within the patient population.
5.Data Integrity Measures: Implementing unique constraints on the "patient_id" column enhances data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.
